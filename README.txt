Antioch 0.7 Alpha

Description:
Antioch is a circuit design program based on the look and feel of Logism.

Installation:
If you have downloaded Python then you have everything you need to run Antioch.
Antioch 0.7 Alpha supports loading Logism .circ files and will automatically 
ignore any features which have not yet been programmed. Note that, your 
schemetics will not look the same and will be very difficult, if not impossible 
to design within Antioch (this is Alpha after all)
